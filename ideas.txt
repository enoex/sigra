-Procedurally generated enemies? Match making...ELO type system. Generates players based on your group's combined weightedscore(?)
-What's the draw? Items, weapons? Virtual progression? 
-Team based or 1v1?
    -If team based, need friends system (probably)

IDEAS:
    -Team based player vs player
    -1 v 1
    -1 + AI vs. 1 + AI. You choose your team, and you face other players.   
        -Can pick classes - e.g., enchanter, wizard, rogue, etc. 
        Idea 1) You can play as one of them
             2) You can play as all of them
             3) You play as one of them, and the other AI is just like a gimped version of the class

    -1 v 1. Pick n characters.
        -Very simple input. Tap unit to make it attack or heal. Can do things like longer you wait to tap, more damage it does
        -How to handle targetting? If it's 6v6, what do you do?
            1) You have a hero, and the n units are like minions (e.g., M:TG). All attacks are directed at you, so it makes healing and shit easier.
                -Different units could add to your abilities. E.g., tanks give you more armor / health
                -Different types of classes could give different buffs
                -Could have a whole slew of unique classes...imagine a charm - when they use the unit, it damages them
            2) Automatic, based on threat; it could be like NPCs in MMOs - targetting is based on threat level.
                -Healers / DPS / etc generate certain amount of threat based on damage done
                TWO Sides: threat meter for enemies, and "threat" for own group. 
                    -How does healer decide who to heal? - Auto based on inverse threat, health, priority, etc.
                        -Could be frustrating, because you cannot yourself control it.
                        -What if you could drag from unit to unit to do the targetting?


# Ramblings:
Metaphors...counterstrike. CS is a team based game, and although you act alone, could we view a CS team as a single entity? Imagine watching a professional team - they play together so well, it's as if it is a single cohesive unit.
    When a player dies, the team can still continue, still can win.
    -Stategies are more important
